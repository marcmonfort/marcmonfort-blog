# About Me

Hi,   I'm **Marc Monfort**, a **Software Engineer** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, **distributed systems**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)**. I’m currently working at the **[Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/)**, where I contribute to **cutting-edge research in data-intensive applications** and emerging system architectures.


I’ve authored several **research articles**, including one published by the **[Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462203.3475896)**. I hold a **Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence** from the **[Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en)** and a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science**. My academic path also includes a one-year exchange program at the **[Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/)** in China and a six-month research internship at the **[National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST)](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/?Lang=en)**, where I deepened my expertise in AI and distributed systems through **international collaboration**.

For a detailed overview of my professional experience, research, and academic background, you can explore my **dedicated CV website at [https://cv.marcmonfort.com](https://cv.marcmonfort.com)**.
