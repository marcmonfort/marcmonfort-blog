# Mixed Reality on Shanghai's Fuxing Island
During the Tongji University International Summer School in Shanghai, I prototyped a small mixed reality (MR) experience focused on Fuxing Island. The goal was to quickly validate how spatial overlays could help visitors and planners visualize layers of history, context, and potential interventions on-site. It was a fast, hands-on project built alongside an international cohort—including fellow UPC students—within a tight sprint.

## What I Built
- A mobile MR prototype that anchors simple 3D markers and annotations to real-world points of interest on Fuxing Island.
- Contextual overlays to surface historic references, urban constraints, and design ideas while walking the site.
- Lightweight interactions to toggle layers, read summaries, and capture quick notes in place.

This was intentionally minimal—prioritizing clarity and on-site usability over heavy visuals—to explore whether MR adds practical value during early-stage urban analysis and storytelling.

Built with 8thwall (WebXR) to run directly in the mobile browser—no app install required.

### Authoring in 8thwall
The scene was assembled and iterated in 8thwall’s web editor. Below is a snapshot of the workspace used to place models, media, and simple interactions:
