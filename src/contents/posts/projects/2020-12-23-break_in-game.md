# Break-In – First-Person Stealth Game Prototype (Custom Engine)

**Break-In** is a prototype of a **first-person stealth game** developed as part of my graphics and game development work. It focuses on core stealth mechanics like **lockpicking** and **enemy detection**, built on top of a **custom rendering and physics engine**.

Key features include:

- **Custom-built rendering pipeline** with real-time graphics
- **Basic physics and collision detection**
- **Lockpicking mechanics and stealth-based gameplay**
- **First-person camera and input handling**

This project demonstrates my exploration of **low-level engine development** and **gameplay system integration**, bridging technical graphics programming with gameplay mechanics.
