# Comp – Custom Game Engine

This demonstration presents **Comp**, a custom game engine built from scratch as part of a computer graphics project. The engine implements:

- **Real-time rendering pipeline** (OpenGL-based)
- **Basic rigid-body physics simulation**
- **Camera and user input management**
- **Scene graph and resource management**

The project demonstrates a bottom-up approach to game engine design, focusing on **low-level graphics programming** and **performance-oriented architecture**.
