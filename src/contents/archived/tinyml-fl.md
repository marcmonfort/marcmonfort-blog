# Federated Learning for TinyML Devices

This project explores how federated learning can be implemented on resource-constrained edge devices using TinyML frameworks.

Originally developed as my bachelor's thesis at UPC, this work includes:

- A custom federated learning simulation platform.
- Integration with TinyML-compatible models using TensorFlow Lite.
- Emphasis on reducing communication costs and memory footprint.

## Highlights

- Devices train local models and share gradients with a central server.
- Simulations show comparable performance to centralized training in small-scale settings.
- Targeted for applications in smart homes and edge sensor networks.
